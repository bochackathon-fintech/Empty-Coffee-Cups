Our chatbot was created using Watson Conversation. The tool uses:
1.	Intents, which are things that the chat users are looking to do like see their budget or set a specific goal,
2.	Entities that are the specific information we want to extract from the user responses, and the
3.	Dialog which is the point to point condition setting to define the process flow of a “normal” conversation.
The code was then integrated with our front-end development package which will interact directly with the user intents to set the entities necessary.
